# MIMO-Antenna
The purpose of this project is to design an ultrawideband circular microstrip patch MIMO antenna that will reduce mutual coupling between the eight elements for 5G and Internet of Things applications, of which two major antenna designs will be evaluated separately for their isolation, bandwidth, and radiation characteristics.
